# Berkeley Earth data

The data are the global land and sea temperature data downloaded from
<https://berkeleyearth.org/data/>.  At the time I (MB) accessed the data (23
September 2023), the link to the data was under the heading "Global Monthly
Averages (1850 â€“ Recent)".

In the same page authors assert the
[CC-By-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license, although
I doubt whether this could reasonably be enforced.

See the processing script for details.
