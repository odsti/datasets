Marcy Kaptur represents Ohioâ€™s 9th district in the US congress.

Her district is working-class, and she argues that the [Democrat party has lost touch with working-class voters](https://www.businessinsider.com/marcy-kaptur-chart-working-class-districts-top-democrats-2023-3)

> During an interview on Monday in her Capitol Hill office, the congresswoman
produced a [two-page
chart](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23726766/rep-kaptur-district-chart.pdf)
that lists every US House district by median income in 2021, with
Democratic-held districts highlighted in blue and Republican-held districts
highlighted in red.

> "You could question yourself and say, well, the blue districts are the
wealthiest districts, so it shows that the Democrats are doing better to lift
people's incomes. The other way you could look at it is: how is it possible
that Republicans are representing the majority of people who struggle? How is
that possible?"

This dataset contains the data from the two-page chart linked above.
