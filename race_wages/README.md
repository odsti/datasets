# Race and wages

This directory contains a data set derived from the paper:

Neal, D. A., & Johnson, W. R. (1996). [The role of premarket factors in
black-white wage
differences](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/Neal%20and%20Johnson%20%281996%29.pdf).
Journal of political Economy, 104(5), 869-895.

Many thanks to Professor Derek Neal, who was very helpful in providing the Stata script to recreate the data and analysis, and an original data file to compare against.

See `./neal_johnson_data.Rmd` for a notebook replicating the data analysis,
from data downloaded from the source, the [National Longditudinal Survey
site](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/access-data-investigator).
