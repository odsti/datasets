# English Premier League wages and points

Each row of the table corresponds to a team competing in the English Premier
League (EPL) for the 2021-2022 seasons. The `points` column of the table gives
the total number of points at the end of the 2021 season (from 38 games).  The
team gets 3 points for a win, and 1 point for a draw, so the maximum possible
points from 38 games are 3 * 38 = 114. The "wages" column gives the estimated
total wage bill in thousands of British Pounds (Â£1000).
