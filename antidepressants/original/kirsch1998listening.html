    <p><b>ABSTRACT</b> <br>
    Mean effect sizes for changes in depression were calculated
    for 2,318 patients who had been randomly assigned to either
    antidepressant medication or placebo in 19 double-blind
    clinical trials. As a proportion of the drug response, the
    placebo response was constant across different types of
    medication (75%), and the correlation between placebo effect
    and drug effect was .90. These data indicate that virtually
    all of the variation in drug effect size was due to the
    placebo characteristics of the studies. The effect size for
    active medications that are not regarded to be
    antidepressants was as large as that for those classified as
    antidepressants, and in both cases, <a name="cite4"></a>the
    inactive placebos produced improvement that was 75% of the
    effect of the active drug. These data raise the possibility
    that the apparent drug effect (25% of the drug response) is
    actually an active placebo effect. Examination of
    pre&#150;post effect sizes among depressed individuals
    assigned to no-treatment or wait-list control groups suggest
    that approximately one quarter of the drug response is due to
    the administration of an active medication, one half is a
    placebo effect, and the remaining quarter is due to other
    nonspecific factors. </p>

    NOTE</b></font><font size="2"><br>
    The article that follows is a controversial one. It reaches a
    controversial conclusion&#151;that much of the therapeutic
    benefit of antidepressant medications actually derives from
    placebo responding. The article reaches this conclusion by
    utilizing a controversial statistical
    approach&#151;meta-analysis. And it employs meta-analysis
    controversially&#151;by meta-analyzing studies that are very
    heterogeneous in subject selection criteria, treatments
    employed, and statistical methods used. Nonetheless, we have
    chosen to publish the article. We have done so because a
    number of the colleagues who originally reviewed the
    manuscript believed it had considerable merit, even while
    they recognized the clearly contentious conclusions it
    reached and the clearly arguable statistical methods it
    employed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We are convinced that one of the principal
    aims of an electronic journal ought to be to bring our
    readers information on a variety of current topics in
    prevention and treatment, even though much of it will be
    subject to heated differences of opinion about worth and
    ultimate significance. This is to be expected, of course,
    when one is publishing material at the cutting-edge, in a
    cutting-edge medium.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We also believe, however, that soliciting
    expert commentary to accompany particularly controversial
    articles facilitates the fullest possible airing of the
    issues most germane to appreciating both the strengths and
    the weaknesses of target articles. In the same vein, we
    welcome comments on the article from readers as well, though
    for obvious reasons, we cannot promise to publish all of
    them.</font></p>

<p id="1">More placebos have been administered to research
participants than any single experimental drug. Thus, one would
expect sufficient data to have accumulated for the acquisition of
substantial knowledge of the parameters of placebo effects.
However, although almost everyone controls for placebo effects,
almost no one evaluates them. With this in mind, we set about the
task of using meta-analytic procedures for evaluating the
magnitude of the placebo response to antidepressant medication. </p>

<p id="2">Meta-analysis provides a means of mathematically
combining results from different studies, even when these studies
have used different measures to assess the dependent variable.
Most often, this is done by using the statistic <i>d</i>, which
is a standardized difference score. This effect size is generally
calculated as the mean of the experimental group minus the mean
of the control group, divided by the pooled standard deviation.
Less frequently, the mean difference is divided by standard
deviation of the control group (<a href="#c61">Smith, Glass,
&amp; Miller, 1980</a>). </p>

<p id="3">Ideally, <a name="cite3"></a>to calculate the effect
size of placebos, we would want to subtract the effects of a
no-placebo control group. However, placebos are used as controls
against which the effects of physical interventions can be
gauged. It is rare for an experimental condition to be included
against which the effects of the placebo can be evaluated. To
circumvent this problem, we decided to calculate within-cell or
pre&#150;post effect sizes, which are the posttreatment mean
depression score minus the pretreatment mean depression score,
divided by the pooled standard deviation (cf. <a href="#c61">Smith
et al., 1980</a>). By doing this for both placebo groups and
medication groups, we can estimate the proportion of the response
to antidepressant medication that is duplicated by placebo
administration, a response that would be due to such factors as
expectancy for improvement and the natural course of the disorder
(i.e., spontaneous remission). Later in this article, we also
separate expectancy from natural history and provide estimates of
each of these effects. </p>

<p id="4">Although our approach is unusual, in most cases it
should provide results that are comparable to conventional
methods. If there are no significant pretreatment differences
between the treatment and control groups, then the subtraction of
mean standardized pre&#150;post difference scores should result
in a mean effect size that is just about the same as that
produced by subtracting mean standardized posttreatment scores.
Suppose, for example, we have a study with the data displayed in <a
href="#table1">Table 1</a>. The conventionally calculated effect
size would be would be 1.00. The pre&#150;post effect sizes would
be 3.00 for the treatment group and 2.00 for the control group.
The difference between them is 1.00, which is exactly the same
effect calculated from posttreatment scores alone. However,
calculating the effect size in this manner also provides us with
the information that the effect of the control procedure was 2/3
that of the treatment procedure, information that we do not have
when we only consider posttreatment scores. Of course, it is rare
for two groups to have identical mean pretreatment scores, and to
the extent that those scores are different, our two methods of
calculation would provide different results. However, by
controlling for baseline differences, our method should provide
the more accurate estimate of differential outcome. <a

<h3 align="left"><i>Study Characteristics </i></h3>

<p id="5">Studies assessing the efficacy of antidepressant
medication were obtained through previous reviews (<a href="#c12">Davis,
Janicak, &amp; Bruninga, 1987</a>; <a href="#c22">Free &amp; Oei,
1989</a>; <a href="#c27">Greenberg &amp; Fisher, 1989</a>; <a
href="#c25">Greenberg, Bornstein, Greenberg, &amp; Fisher, 1992</a>;
<a href="#c70">Workman &amp; Short, 1993</a>), supplemented by a
computer search of PsycLit and MEDLINE databases from 1974 to
1995 using the search terms <i>drug-therapy or pharmacotherapy or
psychotherapy or placebo and depression or affective disorders.</i>
<i>Psychotherapy</i> was included as a search term for the
purpose of obtaining articles that would allow estimation of
changes occurring in no-treatment and wait-list control groups, a
topic to which we return later in this article. Approximately
1,500 publications were produced by this literature search. These
were examined by the second author, and those meeting the
following criteria were included in the meta-analysis: </p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>The sample was restricted to patients with a
                primary diagnosis of depression. Studies were
                excluded if participants were selected because of
                other criteria (eating disorders, substance
                abuse, physical disabilities or chronic medical
                conditions), as were studies in which the
                description of the patient population was vague
                (e.g., <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>neurotic<font
                face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>). </li>
            <li>Sufficient data were reported or obtainable to
                calculate within-condition effect sizes. This
                resulted in the exclusion of studies for which
                neither pre&#150;post statistical tests nor
                pretreatment means were available. </li>
            <li>Data were reported for a placebo control group. </li>
            <li>Participants were assigned to experimental
                conditions randomly. </li>
            <li>Participants were between the ages of 18 and 75. </li>
        </ol>

</blockquote>

<p id="6">Of the approximately 1,500 studies examined, 20 met the
inclusion criteria. Of these, all but one were studies of the
acute phase of therapy, with treatment durations ranging from 1
to 20 weeks (<em>M</em> = 4.82). The one exception (<a
href="#c15">Doogan &amp; Caillard, 1992</a>) was a maintenance
study, with a duration of treatment of 44 weeks. Because of this
difference, Doogan and Caillard's study was excluded from the
meta-analysis. Thus, the analysis was conducted on 19 studies
containing 2,318 participants, of whom 1,460 received medication
and 858 received placebo. Medications studied were amitriptyline,
amylobarbitone, fluoxetine, imipramine, paroxetine,
isocarboxazid, trazodone, lithium, liothyronine, adinazolam,
amoxapine, phenelzine, venlafaxine, maprotiline, tranylcypromine,
and bupropion. </p>

<h3><i>The Calculation of Effect Sizes </i></h3>

<p id="7">In most cases, effect sizes (<i>d</i>) were calculated
for measures of depression as the mean posttreatment score minus
the mean pretreatment score, divided by the pooled standard
deviation (<em>SD</em>). Pretreatment <em>SD</em>s were used in
place of pooled <em>SD</em>s in calculating effect sizes for four
studies in which posttreatment <em>SD</em>s were not reported (<a
href="#c48">Ravaris, Nies, Robinson, et al., 1976</a>; <a
href="#c50">Rickels &amp; Case, 1982</a>; <a href="#c51">Rickels,
Case, Weberlowsky, et al., 1981</a>; <a href="#c53">Robinson,
Nies, &amp; Ravaris, 1973</a>). The methods described by <a
href="#c61">Smith et al. (1980)</a> were used to estimate effect
sizes for two studies in which means and <em>SD</em>s were not
reported. One of these studies (<a href="#c23">Goldberg, Rickels,
&amp; Finnerty, 1981</a>) reported the <i>t</i> value for the
pre&#150;post comparisons. The effect size for this study was
estimated using the formula: </p>
<!--DFORMULA-->
<blockquote>
    <p id="8"><i>d</i>= <em>t</em> (2/<em>n</em>)<sup>1/2</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="9">where <i>t</i> is the reported <i>t</i> value for the
pre&#150;post comparison, and <em>n</em> is the number of
subjects in the condition. The other study (<a href="#c35">Kiev
&amp; Okerson, 1979</a>) reported only that there was a
significant difference between pre- and posttreatment scores. As
suggested by <a href="#c61">Smith et al. (1980)</a>, the
following formula for estimating the effect size was used: </p>
<!--DFORMULA-->
<blockquote>
    <p id="10"><i>d</i>= 1.96 (2/<em>n</em>)<sup> 1/2 </sup>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="11">where 1.96 is used as the most conservative estimation
of the <em>t</em> value at the .05 significance level used by
Kiev and Okerson. These two two effect sizes were also corrected
for pre&#150;post correlation by multiplying the estimated effect
size by (1 - <i>r</i>)<sup> 1/2</sup> , <i>r</i> being the
estimate of the test&#150;retest correlation (<a href="#c31">Hunter
&amp; Schmidt, 1990</a>). <a href="#c2">Bailey and Coppen (1976)</a>
reported test&#150;retest correlations of .65 for the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI; <a href="#c5">Beck, Ward, Mendelson,
Mock, &amp; Erbaugh, 1961</a>) and .50 for the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HRS-D; <a href="#c29">Hamilton, 1960</a>) .
Therefore, in order to arrive at an estimated effect size,
corrected for the pre&#150;post correlation, the estimated effect
sizes of the HRS-D were multiplied by 0.707 and the effect sizes
of the BDI were multiplied by 0.59. </p>

<p id="12"><a name="cite5"></a>In studies reporting multiple
measures of depression, an effect size was calculated for each
measure and these were then averaged. In studies reporting the
effects of two drugs, a single mean effect size for both was
calculated for the primary analysis. In a subsequent analysis,
the effect for each drug was examined separately. In both
analyses, we calculated mean effect sizes weighted for sample
size (<i>D</i>; <a href="#c31">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 1990</a>). </p>
<!--SUBSECT1-->
<h3><i>Effect Sizes </i></h3>

<p id="13">Sample sizes and effect sizes for patients receiving
medication or placebo are presented in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>.
Mean effect sizes, weighted for sample size, were 1.55 <em>SD</em>s
for the medication response and 1.16 for the placebo response.
Because effect sizes are obtained by dividing both treatment
means by a constant (i.e., the pooled <em>SD</em>), they can be
treated mathematically like the scores from which they are
derived. <a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> In particular, we have
shown that, barring pretreatment between-group differences,
subtracting the mean pre&#150;post effect size of the control
groups from the mean pre&#150;post effect size of the
experimental groups is equivalent to calculating an effect size
by conventional means. Subtracting mean placebo response rates
from mean drug response rates reveals a mean medication effect of
0.39 <em>SD</em>s. This indicates that 75% of the response to the
medications examined in these studies was a placebo response, and
at most, 25% might be a true drug effect. This does not mean that
only 25% of patients are likely to respond to the pharmacological
properties of the drug. Rather, it means that for a typical
patient, 75% of the benefit obtained from the active drug would
also have obtained from an inactive placebo. <a name="table2"></a></p>

<p id="14">Inspection of Table 2 reveals considerable variability
in drug and placebo response effect sizes. As a first step toward
clarifying the reason for this variability, we calculated the
correlation between drug response and placebo response, which was
found to be exceptionally high, <i>r</i> = .90, <i>p</i> &lt;
.001 (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). This indicates that <a
name="cite7"></a>the placebo response was proportionate to the
drug response, with remaining variability most likely due to
measurement error. <a name="fig1"></a></p>

    <p><em>Figure 1.</em> The placebo response as a predictor of
    the drug response. </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="15">Our next question was the source of the common
variability. One possibility is that the correlation between
placebo and drug response rates are due to between-study
differences in sample characteristics (e.g., inpatients vs.
outpatients, volunteers vs. referrals, etc.). Our analysis of
psychotherapy studies later in this article provides a test of
this hypothesis. If the correlation is due to between-study
differences in sample characteristics, a similar correlation
should be found between the psychotherapy and no-treatment
response rates. In fact, the correlation between the
psychotherapy response and the no-treatment response was
nonsignificant and in the opposite direction. <a name="cite6"></a>This
indicates that common sample characteristics account for little
if any of the relation between treatment and control group
response rates. </p>

<p id="16">Another possibility is that the close correspondence
between placebo and drug response is due to differences in
so-called nonspecific variables (e.g., provision of <a
name="cite1"></a>a supportive relationship, color of the
medication, patients<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>
expectations for change, biases in clinician<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s ratings, etc.), which
might vary from study to study, but which would be common to
recipients of both treatments in a given study. Alternately, the
correlation might be associated with differences in the
effectiveness of the various medications included in the
meta-analysis. This could happen if more effective medications
inspired greater expectations of improvement among patients or
prescribing physicians (<a href="#c21">Frank, 1973</a>; <a
href="#c39">Kirsch, 1990</a>). <a href="#c17">Evans (1974)</a>,
for example, reported that placebo morphine was substantially
more effective than placebo aspirin. Finally, both factors might
be operative. </p>

<p id="17">We further investigated this issue by examining the
magnitude of drug and placebo responses as a function of type of
medication. We subdivided medication into four types: (a)
tricyclics and tetracyclics, (b) selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRI), (c) other antidepressants, and (d) other
medications. This last category consisted of four medications
(amylobarbitone, lithium, liothyronine, and adinazolam) that are
not considered antidepressants. </p>

<p id="18">Weighted (for sample size) mean effect sizes of the
drug response as a function of type of medication are shown in <a
href="#table3">Table 3</a>, along with corresponding effect sizes
of the placebo response and the mean effect sizes of placebo
responses as a proportion of drug responses. These data reveal
relatively little variability in drug response and even less
variability in the ratio of placebo response to drug response, as
a function of drug type. For each type of medication, the effect
size for the active drug response was between 1.43 and 1.69, and
the inactive placebo response was between 74% and 76% of the
active drug response. These data suggest that the between-drug
variability in drug and placebo response was due entirely to
differences in the placebo component of the studies. <a

<p id="19">Differences between active drug responses and inactive
placebo responses are typically interpreted as indications of
specific pharmacologic effects for the condition being treated.
However, this conclusion is thrown into question by the data
derived from active medications that are not considered effective
for depression. It is possible that these drugs affect depression
indirectly, perhaps by improving sleep or lowering anxiety. But
if this were the case and if antidepressants have a specific
effect on depression, then the effect of these other medications
ought to have been less than the effect of antidepressants,
whereas our data indicate that the response to these
nonantidepressant drugs is at least as great as that to
conventional antidepressants. </p>

<p id="20"><a name="cite8"></a>A second possibility is that
amylobarbitone, lithium, liothyronine, and adinazolam are in fact
antidepressants. This conclusion is rendered plausible by the
lack of understanding of the mechanism of clinical action of
common antidepressants (e.g., tricyclics). If the classification
of a drug as an antidepressant is established by its efficacy,
rather than by knowledge of the mechanism underlying its effects,
then amylobarbitone, lithium, liothyronine, and adinazolam might
be considered specifics for depression. </p>

<p id="21">A third possibility is that these medications function
as active placebos (i.e., active medications without specific
activity for the condition being treated). <a href="#c27">Greenberg
and Fisher (1989)</a> summarized data indicating that the effect
of antidepressant medication is smaller when it is compared to an
active placebo than when it is compared to an inert placebo (also
see <a href="#c28">Greenberg &amp; Fisher, 1997</a>). By
definition, the only difference between active and inactive
placebos is the presence of pharmacologically induced side
effects. Therefore, differences in responses to active and inert
placebos could be due to the presence of those side effects. Data
from other studies indicate that most participants in studies of
antidepressant medication are able to deduce whether they have
been assigned to the drug condition or the placebo condition (<a
href="#c6">Blashki, Mowbray, &amp; Davies, 1971</a>; <a
href="#c43">Margraf, Ehlers, Roth, Clark, Sheikh, Agras, &amp;
Taylor, 1991</a>; <a href="#c45">Ney, Collins, &amp; Spensor,
1986</a>).<sup> </sup>This is likely to be associated with their
previous experience with antidepressant medication and with
differences between drug and placebo in the magnitude of side
effects. Experiencing more side effects, patients in active drug
conditions conclude that they are in the drug group; experiencing
fewer side effects, patients in placebo groups conclude that they
are in the placebo condition. This can be expected to produce an
enhanced placebo effect in drug conditions and a diminished
placebo effect in placebo groups. Thus, the apparent drug effect
of antidepressants may in fact be a placebo effect, magnified by
differences in experienced side effects and the patient<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s subsequent recognition of
the condition to which he or she has been assigned. Support for
this interpretation of data is provided by a meta-analysis of
fluoxetine (Prozac), in which a correlation of .85 was reported
between the therapeutic effect of the drug and the percentage of
patients reporting side effects (<a href="#c26">Greenberg,
Bornstein, Zborowski, Fisher, &amp; Greenberg, 1994</a>). </p>
<!--SECTION-->
<h2 align="center"><b>Natural History Effects</b> </h2>

<p id="22">Just as it is important to distinguish between a drug
response and a drug effect, so too is it worthwhile to
distinguish between a placebo response and a placebo effect (<a
href="#c19">Fisher, Lipman, Uhlenhuth, Rickels, &amp; Park, 1965</a>).
A drug response is the change that occurs after administration of
the drug. The effect of the drug is that portion of the response
that is due to the drug's chemical composition; it is the
difference between the drug response and the response to placebo
administration. A similar distinction can be made between placebo
responses and placebo effects. The placebo response is the change
that occurs following administration of a placebo. However,
change might also occur without administration of a placebo. It
may be due to spontaneous remission, regression toward the mean,
life changes, the passage of time, or other factors. The placebo
effect is the difference between the placebo response and changes
that occur without the administration of a placebo (<a
href="#c38">Kirsch, 1985</a>, <a href="#c40">1997</a>). </p>

<p id="23">In the preceding section, we evaluated the placebo
response as a proportion of the response to antidepressant
medication. The data suggest that at least 75% of the drug
response is a placebo response, but it does not tell us the
magnitude of the placebo effect. What proportion of the placebo
response is due to expectancies generated by placebo
administration, and what proportion would have occurred even
without placebo administration? That is a much more difficult
question to answer. We have not been able to locate any studies
in which pre- and posttreatment assessments of depression were
reported for both a placebo group and a no-treatment or wait-list
control group. For that reason, we turned to psychotherapy
outcome studies, in which the inclusion of untreated control
groups is much more common. </p>

<p id="24">We acknowledge that the use of data from psychotherapy
studies as a comparison with those from drug studies is far less
than ideal. Participants in psychotherapy studies are likely to
differ from those in drug studies on any number of variables.
Furthermore, the assignment of participants to a no-treatment or
wait-list control group might also effect the course of their
disorder. For example, <a href="#c21">Frank (1973)</a> has argued
that the promise of future treatment is sufficient to trigger a
placebo response, and a wait-list control group has been
conceputalized as a placebo control group in at least one
well-known outcome study (<a href="#c60">Sloane, Staples,
Cristol, Yorkston, &amp; Whipple, 1975</a>). Conversely, one
could argue that being assigned to a no-treatment control group
might strengthen feelings of hopelessness and thereby increase
depression. Despite these problems, the no-treatment and
wait-list control data from psychotherapy outcome studies may be
the best data currently available for estimating the natural
course of untreated depression. Furthermore, the presence of both
types of untreated control groups permits evaluation of <a
href="#c21">Frank<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s
(1973)</a> hypothesis about the curative effects of the promise
of treatment. </p>

<h3><i>Study Characteristics </i></h3>

<p id="25">Studies assessing changes in depression among
participants assigned to wait-list or no-treatment control groups
were obtained from the computer search described earlier,
supplemented by an examination of previous reviews (<a
href="#c13">Dobson, 1989</a>; <a href="#c22">Free, &amp; Oei,
1989</a>; <a href="#c52">Robinson, Berman, &amp; Neimeyer, 1990</a>).
The publications that were produced by this literature search
were examined by the second author, and those meeting the
following criteria were included in the meta-analysis: </p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>The sample was restricted to patients with a
                primary diagnosis of depression. Studies were
                excluded if participants were selected because of
                other criteria (eating disorders, substance
                abuse, physical disabilities or chronic medical
                conditions), as were studies in which the
                description of the patient population was vague
                (e.g., <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>neurotic<font
                face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>). </li>
            <li>Sufficient data were reported or obtainable to
                calculate within-condition effect sizes. </li>
            <li>Data were reported for a wait-list or
                no-treatment control group. </li>
            <li>Participants were assigned to experimental
                conditions randomly. </li>
            <li>Participants were between the ages of 18 and 75. </li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p id="26">Nineteen studies were found to meet these inclusion
criteria, and in all cases, sufficient data had been reported to
allow direct calculation of effect sizes as the mean
posttreatment score minus the mean pretreatment score, divided by
the pooled <em>SD</em>. Although they are incidental to the main
purposes of this review, we examined effect sizes for
psychotherapy as well as those for no-treatment and wait-list
control groups. </p>
<!--SUBSECT1-->
<h3><i>Effect Sizes </i></h3>

<p id="27">Sample sizes and effect sizes for patients assigned to
psychotherapy, wait-list, and no-treatment are presented in <a
href="table4">Table 4</a>. Mean pre&#150;post effect sizes,
weighted for sample size, were 1.60 for the psychotherapy
response and 0.37 for wait-list and no-treatment control groups.
Participants given the promise of subsequent treatment (i.e.,
those in wait-list groups) did not improve more than those not
promised treatment. <a name="cite10"></a>Mean effect sizes for
these two conditions were 0.36 and 0.39, respectively. The
correlation between effect sizes (<i>r</i> = -.29) was not
significant. <a name="table4"></a></p>

<h3><i>Comparison of Participants in the Two Groups of Studies </i></h3>

<p id="28">Comparisons of effect sizes from different sets of
studies is common in meta-analysis. Nevertheless, we examined the
characteristics of the samples in the two types of studies to
assess their comparability. Eighty-six percent of the
participants in the psychotherapy studies were women, as were 65%
of participants in the drug studies. The age range of
participants was 18 to 75 years (<em>M</em> = 30.1) in the
psychotherapy studies and 18 to 70 years (<em>M</em> = 40.6) in
the drug studies. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 20 weeks
(<em>M</em> = 4.82) in psychotherapy studies and from 2 to 15
weeks (<em>M</em> = 5.95) in pharmacotherapy studies. The HRS-D
was used in 15 drug studies involving 2,016 patients and 5
psychotherapy studies with 191 participants. Analysis of variance
weighted by sample size did not reveal any significant
differences in pretreatment HRS-D scores between patients in the
drug studies (<em>M</em> = 23.93, <em>SD</em> = 5.20) and
participants in the psychotherapy studies (<em>M</em> = 21.34, <em>SD</em>
= 5.03). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used in 4 drug
studies involving 261 patients and in 17 psychotherapy studies
with 677 participants. Analysis of variance weighted by sample
size did not reveal any significant differences in pretreatment
BDI scores between participants in drug studies (<em>M</em> =
21.58, <em>SD</em> = 8.23) and those in psychotherapy studies (<em>M</em>
= 21.63, <em>SD</em> = 6.97). <a name="cite9"></a>Thus,
participants in the two types of studies were comparable in
initial levels of depression. These analyses also failed to
reveal any pretreatment differences as a function of group
assignment (treatment or control) or the interaction between type
of study and group assignment. </p>

<h3><i>Estimating the Placebo Effect </i></h3>

<p id="29">Just as drug effects can be estimated as the drug
response minus the placebo response, placebo effects can be
estimated as the placebo response minus the no-treatment
response. Using the effect sizes obtained from the two
meta-analyses reported above, this would be 0.79 (1.16 - 0.37). <a
href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> displays the estimated drug, placebo,
and no-treatment effect sizes as proportions of the drug response
(i.e., 1.55 <em>SD</em>s). These data indicate that approximately
one quarter of the drug response is due to the administration of
an active medication, one half is a placebo effect, and the
remaining quarter is due to other nonspecific factors. </p>

<h2 align="center">Discussion </h2>

<p id="30"><a name="cite2"></a>No-treatment effect sizes and
effect sizes for the placebo response were calculated from
different sets of studies. Comparison across different samples is
common in meta-analyses. For example, effect sizes derived from
studies of psychodynamic therapy are often compared to those
derived from studies of behavior therapy (e.g., <a href="#c1">Andrews
&amp; Harvey, 1981</a>; <a href="#c61">Smith et al., 1980</a>).
Nevertheless, comparisons of this sort should be interpreted
cautiously. Participants volunteering for different treatments
might come from a different populations, and when data for
different conditions are drawn from different sets of studies,
participants have not been assigned randomly to these conditions.
Also, assignment to a no-treatment or wait-list control group is
not the same as no intervention at all. Therefore, our estimates
of the placebo effect and natural history component of the
response to antidepressant medication should be considered
tentative. Nevertheless, when direct comparisons are not
available, these comparisons provide the best available estimates
of comparative effectiveness. Furthermore, in at least some
cases, these estimates have been found to yield results that are
comparable to those derived from direct comparisons of groups
that have been randomly assigned to condition (<a href="#c39">Kirsch,
1990</a>; <a href="#c57">Shapiro &amp; Shapiro, 1982</a>). </p>

<p id="31">Unlike our estimate of the effect of natural history
as a component of the drug response, our estimate of the placebo
response as a proportion of the drug response was derived from
studies in which participants from the same population were
assigned randomly to drug and placebo conditions. Therefore, the
estimate that only 25% of the drug response is due to the
administration of an active medication can be considered
reliable. Confidence in the reliability of this estimate is
enhanced by the exceptionally high correlation between the drug
response and the placebo response. This association is high
enough to suggest that any remaining variance in drug response is
error variance associated with imperfect reliability of
measurement. Examining estimates of active drug and inactive
placebo responses as a function of drug type further enhances
confidence in the reliability of these estimates. Regardless of
drug type, the inactive placebo response was approximately 75% of
the active drug response. </p>

<p id="32">We used very stringent criteria in selecting studies
for inclusion in this meta-analysis, and it is possible that data
from a broader range of studies would have produced a different
outcome. However, the effect size we have calculated for the
medication effect (<em>D</em> = .39) is comparable to those
reported in other meta-analyses of antidepressant medication
(e.g., <a href="#c25">Greenberg et al., 1992</a>, <a href="#c26">1994</a>;
<a href="#c34">Joffe, Sokolov, &amp; Streiner, 1996</a>; <a
href="#c47">Quality Assurance Project, 1983</a>; <a href="#c61">Smith
et al., 1980</a>; <a href="#c63">Steinbrueck, Maxwell, &amp;
Howard, 1983</a>). Comparison with the <a href="#c34">Joffe et
al. (1996)</a> meta-analysis is particularly instructive, because
that study, like ours, included estimates of pre&#150;post effect
sizes for both drug and placebo. Although only two studies were
included in both of these meta-analyses and somewhat different
calculation methods were used, <a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>
their results were remarkably similar to ours. They reported mean
pre&#150;post effect sizes of 1.57 for medication and 1.02 for
placebo and a medication versus placebo effect size of .50. </p>

<p id="33">Our results are in agreement with those of other
meta-analyses in revealing a substantial placebo effect in
antidepressant medication and also a considerable benefit of
medication over placebo. They also indicate that the placebo
component of the response to medication is considerably greater
than the pharmacological effect. However, there are two aspects
of the data that have not been examined in other meta-analyses of
antidepressant medication. These are (a) the exceptionally high
correlation between the placebo response and the drug response
and (b) the effect on depression of active drugs that are not
antidepressants. Taken together, these two findings suggest the
possibility that antidepressants might function as active
placebos, in which the side-effects amplify the placebo effect by
convincing patients of that they are receiving a potent drug. </p>

<p id="34">In summary, the data reviewed in this meta-analysis
lead to a confident estimate that the response to inert placebos
is approximately 75% of the response to active antidepressant
medication. Whether the remaining 25% of the drug response is a
true pharmacologic effect or an enhanced placebo effect cannot
yet be determined, because of the relatively small number of
studies in which active and inactive placebos have been compared
(<a href="#c20">Fisher &amp; Greenberg, 1993</a>). Definitive
estimates of placebo component of antidepressant medication will
require four arm studies, in which the effects of active
placebos, inactive placebos, active medication, and natural
history (e.g., wait-list controls) are examined. In addition,
studies using the balanced placebo design would be of help, as
these have been shown to diminish the ability of subjects to
discover the condition to which they have been assigned (<a
href="#c41">Kirsch &amp; Rosadino, 1993</a>). </p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a><sup>1</sup> A reviewer suggested that
because effect sizes are essentially <em>z</em>-scores in a
hypothetically normal distribution, one might use percentile
equivalents when examining the proportion of the drug response
duplicated by the placebo response. As an example of why this
should not be done, consider a treatment that improves
intelligence by 1.55 <em>SD</em>s (which is approximately at the
6<sup>th</sup> percentile) and another that improves it by 1.16 <em>SD</em>s
(which is approximately at the 12<sup>th</sup> percentile). Our
method indicates that the second is 75% as effective as the
first. The reviewer's method suggests that it is only 50% as
effective. Now let's convert this to actual IQ changes and see
what happens. If the IQ estimates were done on conventional
scales (<em>SD</em> = 15), this would be equivalent to a change
of 23.25 points by the first treatment and 17.4 points by the
second. Note that the percentage relation is identical whether
using <em>z</em>-scores or raw scores, because the <em>z</em>-score
method simply divides both numbers by a constant. </p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a><sup>2</sup> Instead of dividing mean
differences by the pooled <em>SD</em>s, <a href="#c34">Joffe et
al. (1996)</a> used baseline <em>SD</em>s, when these were
available, in calculating effect sizes. When baseline <em>SD</em>s
were not available, which they reported to be the case for most
of the studies they included, they used estimates taken from
other studies. Also, they used a procedure derived from <a
href="#c30">Hedges and Olkin (1995)</a> to weight for differences
in sample size, whereas we used the more straightforward method
recommended by <a href="#c31">Hunter and Schmidt (1990)</a>. </p>
