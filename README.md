# Interesting datasets for teaching data analysis

There is one directory per dataset.

Each directory contains the original data (if small enough), a Jupyter Notebook
or Python `.py` script to analyze the data, and a directory `processed` with
new copies of the data as output from the notebook / script.

The Jupyter notebooks are in native `.ipynb` format, and in `.Rmd` RMarkdown
format, for ease of editing and version control.

I use the excellent [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to interact
with the RMarkdown versions of the files.

See the `README.md` file in each directory for license / copyright of the files
in that directory.
