# Baby weight data

Data found via <https://rpubs.com/s2003493/Birthweight-Analysis>, and thence
<https://github.com/HwaiTengTeoh/Newborns-Weight-Prediction>.  From the
description there, source was
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csci-ml-s19-pa1>.  A comparison , and
from from
<https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.29/10446> (now
"deaccessioned") (link via
<https://gist.github.com/rakeshchada/7e480b2a8fe7ff7e8f16>).


So, I assume, without strong evidence, that these are an edited subset of the
North Carolina Vital Statistics from 2008, with baby birth weight for all
babies born in North Carolina.
