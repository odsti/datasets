# Crying by country

Hat-tip to [Rob
Henderson](https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/artifice-girl-blinded-by-beauty-speaking) for pointing me to this dataset.

The data are from Table 1 of:

Dianne A. van Hemert, Fons J. R. van de Vijver, and Ad J. J. M. Vingerhoets (2011) "Culture and Crying: Prevalences and Gender Differences" *Cross-Cultural Research* Volume 45, Issue 4; https://doi.org/10.1177/1069397111404519

> Both crying measures were taken from the questionnaire applied in the ISAC
(Vingerhoets & Cornelius, 2001). In some countries the questionnaires were
completed in classes, in other countries the questionnaires were filled out at
home. The inventory contained questions focusing on several aspects of cry-
ing, including crying tendency, the supposed role of crying for emotional
recovery, and implicit theories on determinants of crying. In the present
study, we only analyzed data on the first aspect. This aspect was assessed by
two items addressing the General Tendency to Cry (10-point scale, ranging
from hardly to very easily) and the Time Elapsed Since Last Crying Episode
(7-point scale, ranging from less than one day ago to more than a year ago).
