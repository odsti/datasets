# Original chart, and party affiliation data

The PDF here is the original chart
<https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23726766/rep-kaptur-district-chart.pdf>.

I (MB) imported the data from the chart using
[Tabula](https://tabula.technology), and did some by-hand cleaning of the CSV, including having to add back the entries in the lowest row for both pages.

The import didn't bring along the colors, giving party affiliation, so I got
those from `legislators_2023.csv`; this is an August 2023 copy of
<https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.csv>, as
of <https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/tree/98e8dce>.
